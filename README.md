# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Perform an analysis of current Pewlett-Hackard employees to forecast upcoming retirements, as well as identify employees that could act as mentors in the future.

## Analysis of Employees Nearing Retirement

### Retiring Staff/Senior Staff and Engineers/Senior Engineers
Upon review of the Employee Database, Pewlett-Hackard stands the potential to lose 32,562 Staff and Senior Staff, and 35,201 Engineers and Senior Engineers. These roles alone account for nearly 45% of all possible retirees.

### Retiring Managers
Of the approximately 72,500 potential retirees, Pewlett-Hackard has only two members of the management team that are ready to retire. This is excellent news, as it would seem that the management team is young and ready to lead PH for the next few years. Had this number been larger, a heavy emphasis would be needed to be placed on training the junior staff to be ready to fill these manager roles.

### Nearly 1/4 of PH Employees Nearing Retirement
As mentioned in the previous bullet, overall there are approximately 72,500 Pewlett-Hackard employees approaching retirement of the 300,000+ total. This is a worrisome sign, as those numbers work out to roughly 24%. PH will need to be on the hunt for young talent to help fill these roles.

### Potential for Senior Technique Leader?
Of the potential retirees, Technique Leaders make up 3,603 of the aforementioned 72,500. However, there appears to be no role for Senior Technique Leader. Would it be beneficial for PH to designate such a role? It would absolutely be an incentive to attract more people to this role.

## Analysis of Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program

### Potential Mentors
In looking for potential mentors, there are only are 1,500 employees with the potential to fill this role. Of the 227,500 employees not slated for retirement, this would mean that less that 1% (.0065% to be exact) of Pewlett-Hackard employees would be eligible to become mentors. Perhaps this is an oversight? Could the criteria be tweaked so that there are more potential mentors? Once the retiring roles are backfilled, and even if all 1,500 employees were selected as mentors, this would mean that there would be 200 employees for every mentor!

### Rating System for Candiates
In selecting mentors, perhaps it would be beneficial to also have a rating system. This would ensure that the best, highest performing team members are selected for the role. Even if someone has been with the company for 10+ years, that alone does not mean that they are a good fit as a mentor. Conversely, even someone who has been with PH for a short time could have a wealth of knowledge and a positive attitude, which would in turn cultivate future leaders for this company.

### Qualifications to be a Mentor
Along with a rating system, it would be a great idea to create a list of qualifications required of a Mentor. Proficiency in a role is great to have, however that alone does not make one competitive in a thriving industry. Qualifications, and unique certifications set employees apart from their peers. Those highly qualified employees would be a great fit as a mentor, so they would in turn be able to guide junior employees along a similar path.

### Time with Pewlett-Hackard
As mentioned earlier, time within Pewlett-Hackard should not be the sole metric by which mentors are chosen. However, our longer-tenured employees would be top choices to help foster growth within our company. Employees that have been with PH the longest, through ups and downs, should be rewarded appropriately. They show a clear dedication to our company and its mission, and would be best suited to pass that enthusiasm to a younger generation.

### Summary of the Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database
In summation, Pewlett-Hackard has a LOT of employees potentially setting off for retirement: 72,458 to be exact. Again, this accounts for nearly one quarter of our current workforce. Difficult times could lay ahead should appropriate action not be taken. Many roles will need to be filled, 50,842 of which are Senior roles.

This could be a positive scenario, however: with so many Senior Engineers and Senior Staff on their way out, younger Engineers and Staff will need to be tapped to fill these positions. This is a great benefit, as it allows upward mobility for our employees. This in turn provides them incentive to remain loyal to PH, as they can see a bright, clear path to the future.
